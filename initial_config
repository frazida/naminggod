Welcome to Naming God, a newsletter of resources and reflections for the spiritual seeker.

This is a website for the unchurched spiritual seeker.

By "unchurched" I mean those who never or infrequently attend church. They may have grown up
in some religious tradition but reached a point in their lives that church-going simply wasn't
worth the investment of time and money. They may have found that the hierarchy and enforced
orthodoxy of organized religion was oppressive.

By "spiritual seeker" I mean those who find reflecting on the nature of the universe and one's place in it a constant preoccupation. Some part of the stories and accounts of one's religious upbringing remain alive or musings on these questions have grown organically from one's daily experience.

This newsletter is an invitation to become part of this spiritual quest. I'm writing as one who is in no way a "credentialled" authority. I offer only an integrity and curiousity that moves me to constantly question my reality and write about my experiences.

I hope that this newsletter will serve to coalesce a community of the like-minded.
